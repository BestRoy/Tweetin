How to get Key and Secret?
===

Twitter has [API Rate Limits](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting "API Rate Limits") when unofficial clients try to connect with your account, but use the API Key and API Secret which created by your own could cut down these limits and have better experience. So we decide to use the API Key and API Secret directly rather than use the account and password. So, how to get Key and Secret?

 1. Go to [https://apps.twitter.com/](https://apps.twitter.com/ "Twitter Apps") and sign in.

 2. Click __Create New App__ button, complete `Name`, `Description`, `Website` with whatever you want. __Don't input anything in the `Callback URL`__. Accept _the Developer Rules of the Road_ and click __Create your Twitter appliction__ button.

 3. Go to the __Permission__ page, change the __Access__ to `Read, Write and Access direct messages`, and then __Update Settings__.

 4. Go to the __Key and Access Tokens__ page, you will see your `Consumer Key (API Key)` and `Consumer Secret (API Secret)`, copy them to Tweetin so you can sign in.

 5. Remember to copy the __Pin__ value when a dialog be shown in Tweetin.

 6. Have a nice trip :)

## Attention:

When you sign in failed, remember to quit Tweetin, wait a moment and then reopen it. Otherwise you would be fail continue.
